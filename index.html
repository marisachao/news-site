        <p>As the Warriors continue to pile on the wins this season, people have begun to wonder whether it is possible for the team
        to beat the record for wins in a season that was set by Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls during the 1995-1996 season and has 
        seemed unbreakable ever since. Even with Andre Iguodala's injury, the Warriors look like they are well positioned to break
        the record this year. Take a closer look at the remaining games on the Warrior's schedule to better understand the team's chance 
        to put their names in the history books.

        <p>Stephen Curry is must-watch TV every time he plays. Coming off an MVP season, he has continued to wow the basketball world 
        with his handles and his shooting. As impressive as he was last year, he has seemingly only improved. He has already broken his 
        own record for 3 pointers made in a single season and is truly dominant during crunch time. Steph's style of play has 
        influenced players at all levels of the game, and it will be interesting to watch how he continues to affect the game.

        <p>The Golden State Warriors are winning games at a historic pace. Each time they take the floor, they make plays that end up 
        on highlight reels. The Warriors have yet to lose a game at home this season. They recently broke the record for most consecutive 
        regular season wins at home, breaking the Chicago Bulls' previous record of 44 straight home wins. No team in NBA history has 
        compiled a perfect season at home before, but the Warriors hope to be the first to do so.
